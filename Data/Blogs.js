In many cases, customers expect OR logic within a filter group (for example, multiple sizes) and AND logic between groups (size + color).\n\nA common approach is to fetch results for individual tags separately and merge them on the front end. This allows more flexible logic while still using Shopify’s collection endpoints and maintaining fast performance.\n\nThe key is to keep the solution app-free, predictable, and aligned with Dawn’s section-based rendering—so it remains upgrade-safe."

The result is a faster, clearer filtering experience that matches how customers actually browse products."
